# Matrix-Matrix-Multiplication-with-MPI
Parallelizing matrix-matrix multiplication using MPI

The following code calculates the wall clock time of matrix mutliplication(both sequential and parallel) of square matrices with sizes ranging from 5000 to 25000 with increments of 5000 with respect to kij index ordering. The calculated times will be printed into 'result_times_serial.txt' and 'result_times_parallel.txt' file within the same directory.
